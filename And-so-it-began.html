      <h1>And so it began</h1>
      <h2 class="date">July 1st, 2013</h2>
      <div><p>I turned the knob to channel 4 and flicked the switch to <code>ON</code>. A light blue screen faded in as the old Zenith TV warmed up.</p>
<pre class="code c64 fade animate">
<div class="center">
**** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****
64K RAM SYSTEM  38911 BASIC BYTES FREE</div>
READY.
<span class="c64_cursor"></span>
</pre>

<p>A white block blinked below.</p>
<p>I picked up <a href="http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_users_guide/c64-users_guide-03-beginning_basic_programming.pdf">the book</a>. It was spiral bound with a colorful cardboard cover decorated with graphs and a photo of the machine. It looked a bit cheesy even to my 10 yearold self, but I was curious and itching to learn what it had to offer.</p>
<p>I leafed through the pages. <code>PRINT</code>, <code>GOTO</code>, <code>BASIC</code>. It was Greek to me, but there was a section in black and white that looked like it a screenshot. I carefully typed the contents, substituting my name for the text between the quotes.</p>
<pre class="code c64">
10 PRINT "LARRY"
20 GOTO 10
RUN
</pre>

<p>I pressed RETURN eagerly. The entire screen filled with <code>LARRY</code> as the first computer program I ever wrote executed.</p>
<pre class="code c64">

<p>I pressed the RUN/STOP key.</p>
<p>All I had really done was instruct the computer to print my name in an infinite loop, but I felt empowered, as if I could tell this little machine to cook my breakfast and it would oblige.</p>
<p>That little book had opened the door to a new world.</p>
<pre class="code c64 animate">
BREAK IN 10
READY.

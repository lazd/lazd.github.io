## Nostalgia is a helluva drug

My first truly personal computer -- not the family computer, but _mine_ -- was a Macintosh SE. My Aunt Joanie gifted it to me after upgrading, and though it was already 10 years old, it was amazing to 10 year old me.

Coming from DOS machines, the elegence and simplicity of the Macintosh really enthralled me. There was no `autoexec.bat`, no `config.sys`, no SoundBlaster and no IRQs to set. You flip a switch and it _just worked_.

And the interface, wow. You were greeted by a friendly chim and the happiest little computer every time you turned it on. Everything was where you thought it should be. The dialog boxes were helpful, the icons friendly, and the applications simple but powerful. The Macintosh hooked me right away, and I used it _constantly_.

I collected software, customized everything, arranged my icons, dragged and resized my windows so they opened just a couple pixels under eachother, played games, fixed it, broke it, and broke it again. I played games on it, scanned pictures, used Photoshop to edit things, created MOD music. It was my escape from reality, where I could control everything and get lost in a world of creativity. Where I could design a house, then fly a paper airplane through it. A portal to another world.

I turned the knob to channel 4 and flicked the switch to `ON`. A  blue screen faded in as the old Zenith TV warmed up.

<pre class="code c64 fade animate">
<div class="center">

READY.
<span class="c64_cursor"></span>
</pre>

A white block blinked below.

I picked up [the book][1]. It was spiral bound with a colorful cardboard cover decorated with graphs and a photo of the machine. It looked a bit cheesy even to my 10-year-old self, but I was curious and itching to learn what it had to offer.

I leafed through the pages. `PRINT`, `GOTO`, `BASIC`. It was Greek to me, but there was a section in black and white that looked like a screenshot. I carefully typed the contents, substituting my name for the text between the quotes.

<pre class="code c64">
10 PRINT "LARRY"
20 GOTO 10
RUN
</pre>

I pressed `RETURN` eagerly. The screen filled with my name as the machine executed the first computer program I ever wrote.

<pre class="code c64">
LARRY

<span class="c64_flash">LARRY</span>
</pre>

All I had really done was instruct the computer to print <code>LARRY</code> in an infinite loop, but I felt empowered. It was as if I could instruct this little machine to work miracles and it would instantly oblige, in capital letters, of course.

That book had opened the door to a new world. I pressed the `RUN/STOP` key.

<pre class="code c64 animate">
BREAK IN 10
READY.
<span class="c64_cursor"></span>
</pre>

A white block blinked below. And so it began.

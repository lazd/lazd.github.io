I turned the knob to channel 4 and flicked the switch to `ON`. A light blue screen faded in as the old Zenith TV warmed up.

<pre class="code c64 fade animate">
<div class="center">
**** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****
64K RAM SYSTEM  38911 BASIC BYTES FREE</div>
READY.
<span class="c64_cursor"></span>
</pre>

A white block blinked below.

I picked up [the book][1]. It was spiral bound with a colorful cardboard cover decorated with graphs and a photo of the machine. It looked a bit cheesy even to my 10 yearold self, but I was curious and itching to learn what it had to offer.

I leafed through the pages. `PRINT`, `GOTO`, `BASIC`. It was Greek to me, but there was a section in black and white that looked like it a screenshot. I carefully typed the contents, substituting my name for the text between the quotes.

<pre class="code c64">
10 PRINT "LARRY"
20 GOTO 10
RUN
</pre>

I pressed RETURN eagerly. The entire screen filled with <code>LARRY</code> as the first computer program I ever wrote executed.

<pre class="code c64">

I pressed the RUN/STOP key.

All I had really done was instruct the computer to print my name in an infinite loop, but I felt empowered, as if I could tell this little machine to cook my breakfast and it would oblige.

That little book had opened the door to a new world.

<pre class="code c64 animate">
BREAK IN 10
READY.
<span class="c64_cursor"></span>
</pre>

A white block blinked below. And so it began.
